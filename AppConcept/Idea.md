# MobiVault : App Concept 


## **Purpose of the App**

**MobiVault** is a file manager with a strong emphasis on mobile security that offers the user the ability to choose between storing their private files either locally and/or on a secure cloud drive. MobiVault is designed to deliver:

* Flexibility/storage options (per file/folder)

* Transparency regarding security policies. The users are clear how and where their data is stored

* Added data privacy via user encryption and biometrics

## **Target Users and Problem Being Solved**

**Target Audience:**

* Privacy-oriented users

* Students requiring appropriate management of academic records

* Professionals handling sensitive documents

**Problem Being Solved:**

* Most mobile file storage apps default to cloud files, and provide no legitimate control

* Users often do not know where files are or how secure their file is

**MobiVault provides a means to:**

* Give users proper control as to where to store data

* Visualize risk levels

* Access and notifications

## **Use Case Scenario**

* A user wants to securely store personal ID photos and PDFs

* MobiVault prompts: **"Local or Cloud?"**

* **Local option** keeps everything local, encrypted, no Internet-connected exposure

* **Cloud option** uploads the file to the user's secure cloud drive, having full encryption-at-rest, and biometric access

* Later, the user receives a notification as the file has been accessed from a different device

## **Comparison to Similar Apps**

**Google Drive / iCloud:**

* Cloud-first, little user control, not privacy-prioritized

**MobiVault:**

* Local-first or cloud-optional

* Users choose storage model per file

* Built-in awareness features (e.g., access tracking, risk alerts)
